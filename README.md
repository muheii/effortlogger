NOTE: There needs to be a folder entitled "logs" in the main directory or else the program will not run.

The planning poker section of this project runs on a web server and the code needs to point to the correct PHP script from the "php" folder.
For this, we used XAMPP, a locally hosted Apache server. To use XAMPP, download and install the program with the default settings. Then, navigate to the `C:\xampp\htdocs\Demo` directory, and create a folder called "Demo". Extract the contents of the "php" directory from the repository into the "Demo" folder. Things should function properly after clicking the "start" button on the Apache line in XAMPP. You may need to create a "rooms" directory inside of the "Demo" folder for things to work 100% properly.
